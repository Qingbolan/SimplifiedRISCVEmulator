# SimplifiedRISCVEmulator

## Project Description: 

> SimplifiedRISCVEmulator is a lightweight and educational RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA) emulator designed for learners and hobbyists. The project aims to provide a simplified version of a RISC-V emulator to help users understand the basics of the RISC-V ISA and develop a foundational understanding of computer architecture.

- The emulator will focus on implementing a subset of RISC-V instructions, allowing users to execute simple programs and observe the behavior of the registers and memory during execution. It will be written in Python, providing a user-friendly interface and enabling easy modification and expansion for advanced users.

- My tasks in this project include:

  1. Research RISC-V ISA: Learn about the RISC-V instruction set architecture, its instructions, and encoding formats. Familiarize yourself with the key concepts of computer architecture, such as registers, memory, program counter, and instruction execution.

  1. Expand the existing emulator code: The provided code snippet is a basic framework for the emulator. Your task is to extend the functionality to support more RISC-V instructions, such as load, store, branching, and arithmetic operations.

  1. Implement a user-friendly interface: Develop a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) for loading programs into the emulator, running the emulator, and displaying the state of the registers and memory after execution.

  1. Test the emulator: Create test programs to ensure that your emulator correctly executes the supported RISC-V instructions. Analyze the results, identify issues, and improve the emulator accordingly.

  1. Documentation: Write comprehensive documentation for the SimplifiedRISCVEmulator, explaining its features, usage, and limitations. Provide examples and tutorials to help users get started with the emulator.

  1. Future improvements: Optionally, you may consider adding more advanced features to the emulator, such as support for the full RISC-V instruction set, performance optimizations, or implementing a graphical user interface (GUI).

- By working on this project, you will gain a deeper understanding of computer architecture and RISC-V ISA, while also honing your Python programming skills. This project will serve as a valuable learning experience and a solid foundation for more advanced computer architecture projects in the future.
